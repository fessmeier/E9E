The rubber seal is difficult to remove.  I filed down an inexpensive pick from Harbor Freight so it would fit and slowly walked it out.

The inner felt piece can be removed by taking off the 4 clips.

To remove the clip the front was pulled up by the pick, then the back was pulled up by the vertical screw driver, and then a second screw driver pushed the clip up and off the trim.
