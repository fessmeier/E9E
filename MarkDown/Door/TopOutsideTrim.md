The rubber seal is difficult to remove.  I filed down an inexpensive pick from Harbor Freight so it would fit and slowly walked it out.

The last thing about the outer trim is that there are 6 clips holding the trim onto the car.  Mine were mostly rusted to the car.  Here is one clip that remained with the trim.  Part 51211803685 (Clamp)  $1.99 X 5
